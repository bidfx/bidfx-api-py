[Exclusive Pricing]
# Use this section to override some or all of the DEFAULT settings for use when accessing the Pricing API

# In most cases this should not be necessary, your account manager will let you if it is.


# When subscribing to user-exclusive quotes the _prices consumed may vary by account.
# Many API consumers use only one account for all subscriptions.
# As a convenience, if a default account is defined here then it will be used for those subscriptions
# for which no explicit account has been provided. The default can be overridden on a per subscription basis.
default_account = TODO

# The Pricing API is capable of publishing _prices at very high frequency.
# This can result in more data than needed or in a process failing to consume _prices at the published rate.
# The price service will throttle back slow consumers, and ultimately disconnect them if the problem persists.
# It is preferable to request the server to always throttle to a minimum publication interval.
# The minimum publication interval is given below in milliseconds.

[Shared Pricing]
# Use this section to override some or all of the DEFAULT settings for use when accessing the Pricing API
# when subscribing to pricing that is shared by all users (e.g. exchange traded products or indicative FX).
# In most cases this should not be necessary, your account manager will let you if it is.


[Trading]
# Use this section to override some or all of the DEFAULT settings for use when accessing the Trading API.
# In most cases this should not be necessary, your account manager will let you if it is.

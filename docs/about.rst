BidFX APIs
==========

BidFX clients access the trading platform via a dedicated User Interface (UI)
either on their desktop PC, web browser or mobile device.

Public APIs provide a secondary means of accessing the trading platform that can either supplement
the UI or replace it entirely in some use cases, including: systematic trading, OMS integration and market intelligence.
BidFX place significant emphasis on API support and therefore
provide a suite of APIs for different high-level programming languages and common protocols.

You can read about the complete BidFX API range, and their different capabilities, at
